"""The one place a capability is described.

Requirement 4 of the owner's directive: prompt and code must read the same
definition, so a field cannot be "required" in one file and "never needed"
in another. `last_name` was exactly that — the model was told it was
required, `_prune_missing` deleted it from the model's own report, and the
create handler asked for it again a turn later.

This module holds no behaviour. It states what a capability needs; the
handlers keep doing the work and the guard keeps deciding whether to act.
Rows are added as flows are converted; nothing here is wired into a flow
that has not been checked against it.
